# Gender Pay Gap Analytics in the UK

## Project Overview
This project explores the gender pay gap across the UK by analyzing public data available through the Gender Pay Gap Reporting regulations. Using SQL, the goal is to perform data analysis to uncover insights about the pay disparities between men and women in various sectors. The project examines salary data and provides a detailed analysis of factors influencing the gender pay gap in the UK.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains gender-specific pay data collected from UK companies that are required to report their gender pay gap under the UK government regulations. The data includes various columns such as company names, median pay, bonus information, and other factors related to employee pay.

### Dataset Access
The dataset can be accessed from [UK Government Gender Pay Gap Data](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/) or from the dataset you have downloaded.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need an SQL environment or a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. The project uses SQL queries to extract insights from the dataset.

### Optional Tools:
- SQL Client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver)
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

## Project Goals
